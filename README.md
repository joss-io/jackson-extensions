# Jackson Extensions

Helpers for automatic integration with Jackson, specifically when using lombok.

## Constructor 

## Builder Traits

Provides support for automatic construction of objects in Jackson using the builder pattern without needing to annotate the class.
 
If the class has a static no-args method named "builder" which returns another class that contains a method "build", then it will match.

The builder will use an empty prefix for the setters as generated by lombok, e.g "Builder.value(val)".

```java


  @Value
  @Builder
  class MyClass {
    private String value;  
  }


  // install the builder traits introspector.
  BuilderTraitsAnnotationIntrospector.install(mapper);
  
  // this now works:
  MyClass read = mapper.readValue(input, MyClass.class);
  
```

## @ConstructorProperties support

Adds support for @ConstructorProperties support, as well as support in 2.7 (which adds it in the core) but with support for mapping field names to external property names by looking at @JsonProperty on the field name itself.

```java
ConstructorPropertiesAnnotationIntrospector.install(mapper);
```
